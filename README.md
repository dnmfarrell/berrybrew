# berrybrew

The perlbrew for Windows Strawberry Perl! 

For a quick-start, jump to the [Installation](#installation) and
[Configuration](#configuration) sections.

`berrybrew` can download, install, remove and manage multiple concurrent
versions of Strawberry Perl for Windows. There is no 
[requirement](https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew#requirements "berrybrew requirements")
to have Strawberry Perl installed before using `berrybrew`.

Updating the list of Strawberry Perls available is as simple as runing a single
command: `berrybrew fetch`, and works at runtime.

There is extensive documentation available for the
[berrybrew](https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew/blob/master/doc/berrybrew.md)
application, as well as the 
[Berrybrew API](https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew/blob/master/doc/Berrybrew%20API.md).
See [SEE ALSO](https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew#see-also) for the
full list of documentation.

        5.10.1_32       [installed]
        5.8.9_32
        5.24.1_64       [custom] [installed] *

    * Currently using
    
Install a specific version:

    > berrybrew install 5.26.0_64

Switch to a different version (permanently):

    > berrybrew switch 5.26.0_64

    Switched to 5.26.0_64, start a new terminal to use it.

Start a new cmd.exe to use the new version:

    > perl -v

    This is perl 5, version 26, subversion 0 (v5.26.0) built for MSWin32-x64-multi-thread

    ...       

Clone an installed instance (very useful for setting up a main instance,
and cloning it into an instance named "template")

    > berrybrew clone 5.26.0_64 template

Uninstall a version of perl:

    > berrybrew remove 5.26.0_64

    Successfully removed Strawberry Perl 5.26.0_64

Manually register a custom directory within the Perl installation directory

    > berrybrew register my_custom_install

Disable berrybrew entirely, and return to system Perl (Strawberry or 
ActiveState), if available (re-enable with 'switch'):

    > berrybrew off

Temporarily use a selected version:

    > berrybrew use 5.10.1_32

Temporarily use a Perl version, but spawn in a new command window:

    > berrybrew use --win 5.10.1_32

Temporarily spawn several versions, all in new windows:

    > berrybrew use --win 5.10.1_32,5.24.2_64,5.26.0_64

Execute something across all perls (we do not execute on Perls that has
'tmpl' or 'template' in the name):

    > berrybrew exec prove -l

    Perl-5.26.0_64
    ==============
    t\DidYouMean.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=5,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.06 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.06 CPU)
    Result: PASS

    Perl-5.22.3_32
    ==============
    t\DidYouMean.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=5,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr +  0.03 sys =  0.06 CPU)
    Result: PASS

    ==============
    t\DidYouMean.t ..
    Dubious, test returned 5 (wstat 1280, 0x500)
    Failed 5/5 subtests

    Test Summary Report
    -------------------
    t\DidYouMean.t (Wstat: 1280 Tests: 5 Failed: 5)
      Failed tests:  1-5
      Non-zero exit status: 5
    Files=1, Tests=5,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr +  0.05 sys =  0.06 CPU)
    Result: FAIL

Execute on only a selection of installed versions:

    > berrybrew exec --with 5.26.0_64,5.10.1_32 perl "die()"

    Perl-5.26.0_64
    ==============
    Died at -e line 1.

    Perl-5.10.1_32
    ==============
    Died at -e line 1.

Upgrade:

    > berrybrew upgrade

Remove `berrybrew` from `PATH` (useful for switching between versions of
`berrybrew`):

    > berrybrew unconfig
    
## Upgrading

Easiest way is to use `berrybrew upgrade`. This requires Git to be
installed and in your `PATH`. It will create a `backup_timestamp`
directory and copy your configuration files into it.

After completion, it'll copy your `perls_custom.json` file back into the `data/`
directory. The rest of the configuration JSON files will be replaced. If you had
any customizations within any of the other configuration files, you'll need to
manually merge those changes back into the updated config file in `data/`.

Doing a straight `git pull` will overwrite your configuration files, so
back them up first (see [Caveats](#caveats)).

## Update Perls Available

Use `berrybrew fetch` to retrieve the most recent availability list from
Strawberry Perl. If any new or changed versions are found, we'll update the
local `perls.json` file with them.

## Configure Root Directory

By default, we manage Perls out of the `C:\berrybrew` directory. To 
change this, modify the `root_dir` value in the `data\config.json` file.
Use double-backslashes (`\\`) as the path separators. 

WARNING: At this time, it is highly advised not to change this after 
you've already installed any instances of Perl. This feature is 
incomplete, and `PATH` and other things don't get properly reset yet.
If you choose to ignore this, follow this procedure:

- run `berrybrew off`, to flush the `PATH` environment variables

- edit the configuration file to reflect the new directory

- move all Perl installations from the old path to the new one

- remove the old directory

- run `berrybrew switch $version` to set things back up

## Compile Your Own 

    git clone https://github.com/stevieb9/berrybrew
    cd berrybrew
    
    # compile the API library

    mcs \
        -lib:bin \
        -t:library \
        -r:Newtonsoft.Json.dll,ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll \ 
        -out:bin/bbapi.dll \
        src/berrybrew.cs

    # compile the berrybrew.exe binary

    mcs \
        src/bbconsole.cs
        -lib:bin -r:bbapi.dll \
        -out:bin/berrybrew.exe \
        -win32icon:inc/berrybrew.ico

    bin\berrybrew.exe config

## Create a Release

If you've modified the information of the configuration files for the new
build, you must copy them to the `dev\data` directory before performing the
below steps.

Use the included `dev/release.pl` script, which:

- compiles the `berrybrew.exe` binary and the `bbapi.dll` API library

- collects default configuration files

- builds the bundled zip archive, and puts it into `download/`

- performs SHA1 checksum tasks

- updates the `README.md` file with the zip archive's new SHA1 sum

If you had any custom configuration files in place, run 
`dev\post_release.pl` to restore them.

## Requirements

- .Net Framework 2.0 or higher

- Windows only!

- [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com) or Visual Studio (only if 
compiling your own version)


## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble installing a Perl, try clearing the berrybrew
cached downloads by running `berrybrew clean`. 

You can also enable debugging to get more verbose output on the command
line:

    berrybrew debug <command> [options]

## CAVEATS

- When using `git pull` to do an upgrade, your configuration files will
be overwritten with the defaults. If you have any customizations, make a
backup of the `data` directory before upgrade, then copy the files back
to their original location. Note that you may have to manually add any
new config directives into the original config files. The 
`perls_custom.json` file used for custom Perl installations (clones) 
will never be overwritten, and this warning does not apply for it.

- At this time, `berrybrew` requires Administrative privileges to
operate correctly. This is due to the way Windows forces the System 
`PATH` to take precedence over User `PATH`.
