Revision history for berrybrew

1.32 UNREL
    - Added 'warn_orphans' config/option directive, default false. Prevents
      the orphaned perls warning, except when 'list' is called (closes #251)
    - Removed 'env' requirement for managing file associations. We now
      dynamically update the ftype in the registry with the absolute path to
      the berrybrew perl currently in use (fixes #244)
    - Switch() now updates FileAssoc() (work on #244)

1.31    2021-01-21
    - Fix issue where on first-run BaseConfig(), if the system didn't have
      a file association set for the .pl file type, we'd attempt to send
      in a null value to Options() for the file_assoc which threw an
      InvalidArgument exception (fixes #237)
    - Added bracing around all conditional and loop structures (if, else,
      foreach etc). This prevents adding additional statements that fall
      outside of the single-line approach
    - All methods and commands now exit with a proper error code
      (closes #236)
    - All paths now exit with an appropriate success or error status
      (closes #239)
    - Added 'error' command, translates error codes to their names
    - Added a display statement to inform the user that we're attempting
      a clone
    - Install() now exits with failure and displays an error message if
      trying to install an already-installed Perl
    - Added 'error-codes' hidden command, returns all valid exit status
      code values
    - Made 'bypassOrphanCheck' object property public so we can set it
      from within the berrybrew binary ('error-codes' specifically)
    - Added 'hidden' command to berrybrew, displays all of the hidden
      commands
    - Moved all of the hidden command details to the berrybrew doc, and
      left a reference to them in the README
    - Added Exit(), a wrapper for Environment.Exit(), and 'exit' command
      for testing
    - Added 'trace' feature. When set, we display the entire stack trace
      to `STDERR`
    - Added 'status' feature. Displays the exit status code and its name
      when exiting the program
    - Added tests in release.pl to verify that SHA checksums and version
      information in README was updated correctly
    - Bumped SSL security to TLS2 for the WebClient() (fixes #248)
    - Remove Exit() from install click in UI, and modified Available()
      to Msg.Print() from Msg.Say() so that it doesn't exit the program.
      The exit was causing the UI to exit as well (fixes #243)
    - error-codes now displays the exit code number as well as its name
    - Compress NSIS directory; Can be extracted when required to build the
      installer
    - Prevent FileAssoc() from exiting when not running as administrator
      (fixes #246)
    - Fix issue where the name of the perl version wasn't being displayed
      if that version was already installed
    - Disabled file association checkbox in installer due to issue #246)

1.30    2019-12-25
    - updated docs to reflect ability to remove berrybrew using
      Add/Remove Programs (closes #209)
    - berrybrew Perls can now be managed through the System Tray Icon
      (closes #210)
    - remove examples/synopsis section of README, and refer to berrybrew
      doc instead (closes #211)
    - berrybrew-ui is now stopped if the installer senses an upgrade is
      occurring (closes #212)
    - added AvailableList() to the API doc (closes #213)
    - fix issue in UI where Switch was duplicating PATH env var
      (fixes #218)
    - configuration information is now stored in the Windows Registry
      (closes #215)
    - added Options(), and 'berrybrew options', used to get/set the
      various configuration option values (closes #216)
    - Strawberry Perl objects now have a new "newest" attribute, to track
      if an instance is the most recent point release of a major version
    - 'fetch' no longer has the 'all' option, it now performs its duties
      with the 'available' command instead. All Perl versions are now
      written to the `perls.json` file (closes #219)
    - Perls that were installed previous to a new point release of a major
      version are now not interfered with and are no longer cast as orphan
      and registered as custom (fixes #217)
    - added 'env.exe' as a binary, and updated installer script and build
      tools to include it
    - added FileAssoc() and 'berrybrew associate'. Allows managing and
      unmanaging Perl file associations (work on #15)
    - we now allow the managing of .pl file association; we set it so that
      the first perl found in PATH is used (closes #15)
    - split out build scripts, so each element (bb, ui, api) each have
      their own (this prevents building all elements all the time)
    - dev and test builds are now identified in the class by the assembly
      directory, and we configure things accordingly instead of using env
      vars (closes #224)
    - added OptionsUpdate() and 'options-update'. Updates the registry
      configuration with any newly added config directives (closes #221)
    - dev and test builds now reliably create and use their own registry
      section
    - installer now removes registry configuration on uninstall, and it
      along with 'upgrade' make a call to 'OptionsUpdate()' (closes #225)
    - installer now has option to allow managing of .pl file association
      (closes #227)
    - added ability to change Perl instance root directory in the
      installer (closes #208)
    - added "Run UI at startup" option in installer
    - added bb.exe, a short-form for the full berrybrew command
      (closes #226)
    - update Configuration document with pertinent information regarding
      the new registry configuration system (closes #222)
    - full documentation review and updates (closes #223)
    - installer no longer requires on "PROGRAMFILES", which allows the
      uninstaller to operate on the correct install directory (closes #228)
    - uninstaller now removes top-level install directory (closes #229)
    - fix issue in OptionsUpdate() where we were updating registry values
      where we shouldn't be, due to not scoping an if() statement
      (fixes #230)
    - added SHChangeNotify() to API, to send an icon refresh if the .pl
      file association changes
    - fix issue in PathRemoveBerrybrew() where if the $INSTDIR in the
      installer had a lowercase drive letter, the PATH would not be
      removed on uninstall (fixes #233)
    - added 'force' arg to OptionsUpdate() along with `options-update-force`,
      to load all config file options into the registry (closes #232)

1.29    2019-12-08
    - add missing closing parens on 'remove' if a Perl isn't installed
      (fixes #196)
    - added "berrybrew info" command, and BB.Info() method. retrieves and
      displays various installation information (paths etc) (work on #193
      and #194)
    - PathScan() now accepts a string to search %PATH% with, as opposed to
      a regex. All methods that add/remove from %PATH% now use BB object
      path attributes so we always know we are looking for/working on the
      absolute correct entry (fixes #193; closes #194)
    - if 'fetch' is called w/o administrator privileges, we gracefully
      catch this and inform the user instead of crashing (fixes #198)
    - installer now uses nsExec::Exec functions as to ensure the command
      line windows we need to open are not visible (closes #200)
    - implemented logic in installer to identify whether there's an
      existing berrybrew, and whether the install will overwrite or sit
      beside it (closes #195)
    - update test data with Perl 5.30.1 data
    - added 'berrybrew-refresh' batch script to allow updating PATH env
      var in current window (saves from having to open new cmd windows all
      the time
    - 'clean modules' and 'clean temp' now check for directory existence
      before processing to avoid uncaught exceptions (fixes #202)
    - added 'register_orphans' hidden command
    - added calls to PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans() in Upgrade() and
      added call to 'berrybrew register_orphans' in the installer. This
      ensures that if 'perls.json' is updated, the old Perl instances will
      be registered and available (fixes #199)
    - if source Perl for clone operation isn't available, exit gracefully
      (fixes #205)

1.28    2019-11-22
    - modified PathAddBerrybrew() to insert berrybrew's path to the start
      of the PATH as opposed to the end of it
    - modified the installer so that it asks the user if we can try to
      disable a previous version

1.27    2019-11-22
    - we now have a self-extracting installer!
    - fix issue where 'list' wasn't showing the 'virtual' tag (fixes #186)
    - aded installer NSIS script and logic to automatically build the
      binary during the release process
    - 'remove' now displays notification of its actions (closes #190)
    - fix label ordering issue in custom_install test file
    - update release script to automatically update version numbers in the
      installer script (closes #189)

1.26    2019-09-02
    - added 'berrybrew virtual' command; allows using external perls (eg.
      installed system Active State) from within berrybrew. Useful for
      bypassing berrybrew switched perls without having to disable berrybrew
      entirely
    - added new 'berrybrew switch x.xx quick' argument, allows switching
      to a new perl without needing to open a new console window (some
      functionality may suffer until a new window is actually opened though)
    - modified calls to String.Compare() to specify a string array instead
      of just a string for .Net 4.6 compliance
    - modified calls to String.Split() to specify a char array instead of
      just a char for .Net 4.6 compliance
    - updated dev\release.pl to create a Changes markdown file for ease
      of online viewing

1.25    2019-08-30
    - fix typo in API doc (fixes #163)
    - added new testing environment variables (set in t\setup_test_env.bat)
      which set up some test-specific flags to shim the system where
      necessary
    - reworked unit test platform; the "dev build" and "test" infrastructures
      are now completely separate. This eliminates issues where in some
      cases, the two environments overlapped each other
    - reworked how the "modules" infrastructure works. We now create the
      directory on 'import' if it doesn't exist, and produce more sound
      warnings in certain circumstances (fixes #169)
    - "clean modules" now leaves any custom export lists in place, and
      operates at file level, not simply remove the entire directory
      (closes #162)
    - added new config file directive, "windows_homedir", which allows a user
      on a global basis to use the Portable homedir (default), or the
      Windows homedir. This happens during 'berrybrew install' (closes #121)

1.24    2019-08-29
    - removed confirmation dialog when running "config" as to allow for
      unattended installations (closes #173)

1.23    2019-05-26
    - fixed issue in README where some external doc links were pointing to
      the wrong branch (fixes #147)
    - removed the "update dnmfarrell repo" section from README; it's been
      moved to the "create a release" doc (closes #146)
    - "Compile your own" link wasn't directing to the proper doc
      (closes #148)
    - added "dev" and "all" to the "clean" operation (closes #149)
    - added t/99_clean.t for testing the "berrybrew clean dev" feature
      (closes #151)
    - added new "test" argument to "berrybrew". This is for developers to
      tell the system we're in unit testing mode to shim the system where
      necessary
    - added an exception handling routine in PerlFindOrphans() to catch an
      error in certain cases when running "berrybrew clean dev"
    - t/95-remote.t no longer cleans up the test directory, that's left to
      t/99-clean.t now
    - slight modifications to the testing infrastructure and documentation
      instructions
    - rename "Synopsis" to "Examples" in README (closes #124)
    - corrected issue in ExecCompile(), where if we're using --with to exec
      with only one perl instance, it wasn't filtering correctly
    - added ExportModules(), saves the current perl's module list for import
      later in a different perl (work on #150)
    - added CleanModules() with new `berrybrew clean modules` to clean up
      the exported module list directory
    - added ImportModules(), ImportModulesExec(), modules export and
      import (work on #150)
    - update all documentation with the new "modules export/import"
      functionality (closes #150)
    - added new "currentperl" hidden command which displays which Perl
      is currently in use. Changed "PerlInUse()" from private to public to
      facilitate the new feature
    - bumped perls.json to include the new 5.30 Perl release
    - several other minor issues closed (mostly small doc fixes etc)

1.22    2018-11-05
    - clarifications and updates to the "Create a Release" doc (closes #137)
    - major, sweeping code refactoring: method privileges, exception
      handling, variable renaming to conform to C# standards etc
    - update API doc with all relevant changes due to the code refactoring
    - update PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans() details in API doc
      (closes #140)
    - added PerlsInstalled() method to API doc (closes #139)
    - added PathGetUsr() method to API doc (closes #138)
    - when running a dev build, the Perl instance and berrybrew temp
      directories are now located under a "build" dir, as opposed to the
      "test" directory as it was previously. This separates the unit testing
      platform from the development build one (closes #114)
    - added "developed using" section in README (closes #141)
    - add new "dev\build_tests.bat" script that the "t\test.bat" script
      calls to set up the unit test environment. We used to call
      "t\build.bat", but since changing the dev build system, we needed to
      separate the functionality (fixes #143)

1.21    2018-11-04
    - updated CONTRIBUTING doc (closes #128)
    - moved the "Compile your own installation", "Create a dev build", and
      "Create a release" README sections to their own documentation files.
      Also greatly expanded on the "Create a release" doc to include steps
      to complete the entire release cycle (closes #126)
    - added a config directive index at the top of the configuration doc
      file (closes #129)
    - integrate hurricup's PR#132, proxy of error code if 'exec' is run
      in single mode (prep for integration with Camelcade Perl5 plugin)
    - test changes in PR#132, and modify docs accordingly (closes #133)
    - the "test" directory is no longer seen as an orphaned Perl install
      (closes #134)
    - add note in "create a dev release" doc that all Perl instances are
      located under the "test" directory (closes #135)

1.20    2018-11-02
    - fix improper indentation of the Off() method in berrybrew.cs
      (fixes #120)
    - add note in Unit Testing doc to update the t/data/available.txt and
      t/data/custom_available.txt files if Perls available has changed
      before running tests (fixes #118)
    - rearrange the Installation and Configuration sections in README
      (closes #122)
    - replace magic number in CheckName() with a private const int
      (closes #119)
    - update examples with most recent Perl versions in README (SYNOPSIS)
      (closes #123)
    - fix a missed exception handling in List() when no Perls are installed
      (fixes #117)

1.19    2018-11-01
    - integrated hurricup's PR#107, which includes changes required in
      preparation for berrybrew's inclusion within the Camelcade Perl5
      intelliJ IDEA plugin
    - added notes regarding version bumping and updating in README
      (closes #108)
    - add new "Create a development build" section in README (closes #109)
    - fix typo in "exec --with" section in SYNOPSIS (fixes #115)
    - added "list" command to docs (bin/API) and README (closes #111)
    - add "Uninstall" section in README (closes #106)

1.18    2018-02-16
    - Perls listed with "berrybrew available" are now listed in numerical,
      descending order (closes #101) (thanks @shawnlaffan for the
      report!)
    - fixed issue where the orphaned Perls that were installed prior to
      using "fetch" weren't being registered as custom correctly (required
      two calls to "fetch"). To fix, added new
      PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans()(closes #102; closes #99) (Thanks
      @pryrt for the report!)
    - added ability to fetch every single Perl version Strawberry has to
      offer with the new "all" argument to "berrybrew fetch" (closes #100;
      closes #103) (thanks @pryrt for the report!)
    - fix issue where we were missing an exception if trying to register
      the same custom version of Perl more than once (fixes #104)

1.17    2017-10-04
    - task information displayed during install operation is now in logical
      order (fixes #95)
    - fix issue where when running the "build" version (ie. unreleased), it
      was using the same Perl installation directory as the "live" version.
      In the build.bat script, we now update the config.json file
      accordingly to ensure we're using two separate install locations.
      (fixes #97)

1.16    2017-08-03
    - UseInNewWindow() and UseInSameWindow() API calls were incorrectly
      listed as "public" in the API doc which are actually "internal", and
      UseCompile() was "internal" and should be "public"
    - gracefully catch a download problem and report to the user
      (closes #63)
    - fix small typo in README (closes #89)
    - gracefully let user know that berrybrew can't be installed in
      c:\berrybrew on "config" (fixes #55)
    - consolodated version info. Only hardcoded in the berrybrew.cs file.
      Removed it from messages.json, and updated release.pl script to bump
      the version in the README at release time (closes #86)
    - replaced calls, where appropriate to PathGet() instead of
      PathRemovePerl(process=false) for clarity (closes #91)

1.15    2017-07-28
    - fix doc links in API, and resized headings in berrybrew doc
      (closes #84)
    - 'register' command now outputs a success message to the console upon
      successful registration (closes #79)
    - use will both output each Perl specified if it's not installed, then
      warn and exit if none of the specified versions are installed
      (closes #83)
    - bumped versions of Perl in doc examples to reflect current
      availability

1.14    2017-07-28
    - code cleanup
    - bumped 5.24.1 to 5.24.2 in perls.json (prod and test)
    - new "use" feature, allows spawning into a different version in the
      existing cmd window, or a new ones. Multiple perls can be specified
      in a single run. This feature acts similar to Perlbrew's "use"
      feature, in that upon exit, you'll automatically be put back to your
      previously "switch"ed version (@pryrt PR #80)

1.13    2017-07-15
    - updated license information (closes #75)
    - updated perls_available.json to include 5.26
    - we now remove the "test" directory after all tests complete
      (closes #76)
    - correct markdown formatting in Configuration doc (closes #73)
    - small README correction (closes #71)
    - added new "register" command, provides ability to register perl
      installs that happened outside of berrybrew (closes #70)
    - add check to ensure we don't duplicate custom registrations
    - massive unit test framework upgrade (thanks pryrt!). There's still
      more work to be done here, but it's already much better
    - changed the bracing syntax. I dislike the opening brace on a separate
      line

1.12    2017-03-31
    - fix local links in the markdown in the documentation
    - added "berrybrew fetch" (PerlUpdateAvailableList()). This function
      fetches the releases.json file from the Strawberry Perl website, and
      updates our data/perls.json file with the most recent patch version
      of each Perl version for 64bit, 32bit and PDL, where each is
      available (work on #62)
    - updated all documentation with the new 'fetch' feature
    - added exception and error handling in PerlUpdateAvailableList() for
      both the web fetch of the JSON file, and the reading of the JSON
      itself
    - enhanced exception handling for 'fetch'. We now print out the full
      exception if in debug mode
    - implement orphan handling for 'fetch'. If there are any orphans, we
      will not proceed any further
    - if there are perl instances orphaned after 'fetch' we now put them
      into the perls_custom.json file so they are still usable. They will
      appear as [custom] installs
    - upgrade now backs up config files, but only restores the
      perls_custom.json file. The user will have to manually merge in any
      custom changes they had from the backup into the updated config files

1.11    2017-03-30
    - replaced Ionic.Zip with SharpZipLib as the former failed to
      consistently extract the zip files completely
    - updated 5.10.1_32 from 5.10.1.2 to 5.10.1.5
    - updated SHA1 checksums for various instances

1.10    2017-02-12
    - fixed issue where the updated perls weren't being reflected in the
      perls.json file in the zip archive
    - added 'unconfig' help menu listing
    - updated SYNOPSIS with more recent versions of Perl (closes #58)
    - a request was made to include the PDL versions, but I'm holding off on
      that for the time being, as I'm focusing my efforts on the automatic
      list update feature (PerlUpdateAvailableList() in the API, I haven't
      decided on the CLI command name yet)

1.09    2017-02-03
    - added 5.24.1_xx and 5.22.3_xx

1.08    2016-11-11
    - doc cleanup/tidying
    - PerlFindOrphans() now ignores the '.cpanm' directory
    - version now hardcoded in the library

1.07    2016-11-11 
    - fix issue where 5.22.2_32 wasn't downloading the portable zip file
      thereby the checksum didn't match (reported by 'atcroft') (fixes #53)
    - test updates/fixes
    - doc updates/cleanup (closes #51 & #54)

1.06    2016-07-26
    - fixed issue where berrybrew config fails if the perl Root dir doesn't
      exist (fixes #46)
    - added "unconfig" command to remove berrybrew from PATH
    - updated API and berrybrew docs (closes #48)
    - removed release.sh, modified release.pl to be cross-platform
    - cleaned up zip file creation
    - better handling of config files for git push
    - perls_custom.json file is no longer included in an install, it is
      created on the fly if it doesn't exist. This prevents it from being
      overwritten during an upgrade
    - changed zip libraries to Ionic.Zip, for easier usage when we
      implement backup/restore functionality
    - added 'upgrade', safely performs a berrybrew upgrade
    - added new attributes 'confPath' and 'binPath'. 'installPath' is now
      the actual root dir of the repo

1.05    2016-07-18
    - updated dev/release.pl to put default config files in place before
      commit/zip
    - added dev/post_release.pl to restore the backups
    - 'exec' no longer will process perls with either 'tmpl' or 'template'
      in their name
    - new config option, 'custom_exec' (default is false) will skip over
      Custom (cloned) Perls on 'exec'. Set to true in the config file to
      exec on them
    - added exception handling for when a clone fails
    - tests now perform their work in a test subdir of berrybrew, as to not
      accidentally remove custom installs as orphans

1.04    2016-07-17
    - added documentation in doc/ for berrybrew, the API and configuration
    - fixed issue with name length, max is now 25 chars for custom perls
    - added CheckName(), validates the name of a custom perl
    - added release.pl and removed release.sh

    - added debug support within API. Set within the data\config.json file.
      For the API, call ``obj.Debug = bool;'', for the CLI, ``berrybrew debug ...''
    - major code restructuring
    - cleaned up Exec() PATH configuration (closes #10, #12 and #23)
    - removed Dir class, path info now stored in member variables
    - added doc/
    - added unit test doc
    - on destruction, we now check for orphaned perl installs, and warn the user
      (closes #16)
    - StrawberryPerl objects are now only generated once, and stored within the BerryBrew
      object
    - removed several unused imports
    - sub command help for the commands that have sub commands
    - 'clean' removes temp files by default, but can also clean orphaned perls with
      the 'orphan' subcommand
    - consolodated ParseJson() and ParseConfig() into the former
    - completed most of the work on the auto updating of the Perls list
    - renamed ParseJson() to JsonParse(), and added JsonWrite()
    - added 'clone', allows cloning of instances with custom names (useful for
      creating perl installation templates, and snapshots)
    - more tests

    - added RemoveFilesystemAttributes(), removes RO flag on all files
      in perl install dirs before deleting. C# can't delete them otherwise
    - the API has been separated out into a DLL for re-use and easier
      testing. Source file for the library is berrybrew.cs. The console app
      resides in bbconsole.cs
    - changed to a more Perlish version numbering system

    - fixed issues where %VARIABLE% based PATH entries weren't being
      expanded properly. We now set the registry value to REG_EXPAND_SZ
      type instead of REG_SZ
    - added initial set of basic Perl unit tests

20160702 2016-07-11
    - added 'clean' option, removes all archive zips of perl (closes #5)
    - consolodated directory locations into a class
    - moved almost all console messages to data/messages.json
    - moved perls.json to data/
    - added exception handling for missing and/or malformed json files
    - variable based PATH env vars no longer get expanded and clobbered (fixes #10)
      (reported by PeterCJ (pryrt)
    - add preliminary ability to change Perl installation directory (closes #11)

20160701 2016-07-07
    - fixed bug where PATH wasn't being set correctly when switching perls
    - added release.sh script, performs all tasks related to a release

    - added perl.Paths to the struct, holds all three paths in a list
    - re-worked the setting of PATH in exec subshells

20160602
    - added 'off' feature, we now play nice with ActiveState and Strawberry
      Perl installations
    - moved from using the User PATH env var to Machine(System) PATH, so
      that 'off' works correctly

20160501 2016-05-13
     - separated fork from dnmfarrell's original
     - added --with flag for exec, like perlbrew
     - added better ENV handling on spawned sub-shells in exec
