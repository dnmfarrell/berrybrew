## Class Berrybrew

#### Available

    public void Available()

Displays the names of the versions of Perl that are available to `berrybrew`,
as found in `this.Perls`, where `this.Perls` is a
`OrderedDictionary<string name, Berrybrew.StrawberryPerl>`.

#### CheckName

    private static bool CheckName(string perlName)

        argument:   perlName
        value:      Name of an available Perl

        return:     true on success, false on fail

Checks the name of a custom Perl to ensure it fits within the guidelines.

#### CheckRootDir

    private void CheckRootDir()

Checks whether the Perl root installation directory exists, and creates it if not.

#### Clean

    public void Clean(string subcmd="temp")

        argument:   subcmd
        values:     "temp", "orphan", "all"

By default, `subcmd` is set to "temp", which we delete all downloaded Perl
installation zip files from the temporary directory. With "orphan", we'll
delete all directories found in the Perl installation root directory that
`berrybrew` has not registered as valid Perl installs.

#### CleanOrphan

    private bool CleanOrphan()

Removes all directories found in the Perl installation directory that aren't
associated with any registered Perl instances.

Returns `true` if any orphans were found/deleted, `false` if not.

#### CleanTemp

    private bool CleanTemp()

Removes all Perl installation zip files from the temporary staging directory.

Returns `true` if any files were found/deleted, `false` if not.

#### Clone

    public bool Clone(string src, string dest)

        argument:   src
        values:     Name of an installed berrybrew Perl instance

        argument:   dest
        values:     Any string name by which you want the clone to appear
                    in 'berrybrew available'

        return:     bool

Makes an exact copy of an existing installed Perl instance with a name of your
choosing, and makes it available just like all others. `berrybrew available`
will label these custom installs appropriately. Returns `true` on success,
`false` otherwise.

#### Config

    public void Config()

Adds the path to the `berrybrew.exe` executable into the `PATH` environment
variable.

#### Exec

    private static void Exec(StrawberryPerl perl, List<string> parameters, string sysPath, Boolean singleMode)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single StrawberryPerl object

        argument:   parameters
        value:      The full command string you want all installed Perls to execute

        argument:   sysPath
        value:      String containing the full Machine PATH environment variable
        
        argument:   singleMode
        value:      True if running on a single Perl instance, False otherwise

Called by `ExecCompile()`, sends a single Perl instance a command to execute.

#### ExecCompile

    public void ExecCompile(string parameters)

        argument:   parameters
        value:      Full command string that Exec() hands off, including
                    any Exec() specific instructions

Sets things up before handing each command off to `Exec()` for final
processing. If the `--with` flag is included, we'll strip it off and only
send the commands to be executed to those specific Perls.

This method sends a single Perl at a time to `Exec()`, and will always skip
any Perls that have either `tmpl` or `template` in the name.

By default, we also skip over all custom (cloned) instances. To have them
included, set `custom_exec` to `true` in the configuration file.

#### Extract()

    private static void Extract(StrawberryPerl perl, string tempDir)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        argument:   tempDir
        value:      The full path to the temporary Perl installation staging directory
        typical:    this.archivePath

Extracts a Perl instance zip archive into the Perl installation directory.

#### Fetch

    public string Fetch(StrawberryPerl perl)

        argument:   perl
        value:      Single instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        return:     The name of the folder the zip file was downloaded to

Downloads the zip file for the version of Perl found in the StrawberryPerl
object, and returns the directory of where it was put.

#### FileRemove

    private static string FileRemove(string filename)

        argument:   filename
        value:      Name of an existing file on the system

        return:     Stringified Exception or "true"

Deletes a file from the file system. Returns stringified "true" on success,
and a stringified `IO` exception on failure.

#### FileSystemResetAttributes

    private static void FileSystemResetAttributes(string dir)

        argument:   dir
        value:      Name of a directory that exists in the filesystem

Recursively resets all files and directories within the directory being
operated on back to default. This method was written specifically to ensure
that no files were readonly, which prevented us from removing Perl
installations.

#### Install

    public void Install(string version)

        argument:   version
        value:      Name of an available Perl, as seen with 'berrybrew available'


Installs and registers a new instance of Perl.

#### JsonParse

    private dynamic JsonParse(string type, bool raw=false)

        argument:   type
        value:      The name of the JSON file, with the '.json' extension removed

        argument:   raw
        value:      bool
        default:    false

        return:     dynamic // object or JSON string

Extracts the JSON string from the various JSON files, and returns it. If `raw`
is set to `false` (default), we send the data back de-serialized. If `raw` is
`true`, we'll send back the JSON string as-is, with no de-serialization.

#### JsonWrite

    private void JsonWrite(
        string type,
        List<Dictionary<string, object>> data,
        bool fullList=false
    )

        argument:   type
        value:      The name of the JSON file, with the '.json' extension removed

        argument:   data
        value:      List of Dictionary objects. Each dict contains the name of an
                    available Perl as the key, and a StrawberryPerl instance as the
                    value

        argument:   fullList
        value:      bool
        default:    false

Writes out a JSON file containing information regarding installed Perls. If
`fullList` is set to `false` (default), we'll read in the existing list in the
file, and append the new objects to it. If `fullList` is set to `true`, we'll
assume you've compiled the list yourself, and we overwrite the file with the
new `data`.

#### List

    public void List()
    
Displays a list of the versions of Perl that are currently installed.
    
#### Off

    public void Off()

Disabled all `berrybrew` managed Perls, by removing them from `PATH`
environment variables. This will return you to a system Strawberry or
ActiveState system installed Perl.

#### PathAddBerryBrew

    private void PathAddBerryBrew(string binPath)

        argument:   binPath
        value:      Full path to the directory the berrybrew.exe binary resides in

Called by `Config()`, this enables `berrybrew` to be called from the command
line without having to specify the full path to the executable.

#### PathAddPerl

    private void PathAddPerl(StrawberryPerl perl)

        argument:   perl
        value:      Single instance of the StrawberryPerl class

Sets the `PATH` environment variables up to ensure the version of Perl
housed in the `perl` object will be used on the system.

#### PathGet

    private static string PathGet()

        return:     String containing the machine's PATH data

Using the registry, retrieves the current Machine (System) `PATH` environment
variable. Using the registry ensures we have the most current data, even if
the current shell has not yet been updated.

Does not expand any variable-based `PATH` entries on extraction.

#### PathGetUsr

    private static string PathGetUsr()
    
    return: String containing the currently logged in user's PATH environment variable
    
Fetches and returns a string containing the currently logged in user's `PATH`
environment variable.    

Does not expand any variable-based `PATH` entries on extraction.

#### PathRemoveBerrybrew

    private void PathRemoveBerrybrew()

Removes berrybrew binary directory from `PATH`.

#### PathRemovePerl

    private void PathRemovePerl(bool process=true)

        argument:   process
        value:      bool
        default:    false
        purpose:    Action a PathSet()

Removes any and all Perl instances from the `PATH` environment variable.
If `process` is set to `true` (default), we'll execute the removal via
`PathSet()`. 

#### PathScan

    private static bool PathScan(Regex binPattern, string target)

        argument:   binPattern
        value:      Regex object containing an executable's filename

        argument:   target
        value:      "machine" or "user"

        return:     true if found, false if not

Looks through either the Machine or User `PATH` environment variables,
searching for the binary name. Returns `true` on success, `false` otherwise.

#### PathSet

    private void PathSet(List<string> paths)

        argument:   paths
        value:      List of strings, each string contains a PATH entry
                    (less the semi-colon)

Builds the semi-colon separated `PATH` string from the list, and inserts it
into the Machine's `PATH` section in the registry. We then send a broadcast
message to the system to advise of the change.

We use this manual method as opposed to C# methods, because we change the
registry value from a `REG_SZ` type to `REG_EXPAND_SZ` type so that we can
preserve and insert variable-based `PATH` entries.

#### PerlArchivePath

    private static string PerlArchivePath(StrawberryPerl perl)

        argument:   perl
        value:      Instance of the StrawberryPerl class

don't have any association or registration with `berrybrew`.

#### PerlGenerateObjects

    private void PerlGenerateObjects(bool importIntoObject=false)

        argument:   importIntoObject
        default:    false
        purpose:    Insert the Perl objects into the Berrybrew object

Collects up both the default and custom available Perls from the available
JSON configuration files, and turns the information into `StrawberryPerl`
objects.

Set `importIntoObject` to `true` to have the list of objects imported into the
`Berrybrew` object, at `this.Perls`.

#### PerlInUse

    private StrawberryPerl PerlInUse()

        return:     Instance of the StrawberryPerl class

Locates which instance of Perl is currently in use, and returns the
`StrawberryPerl` object that represents it.

#### PerlIsInstalled

    private static bool PerlIsInstalled(StrawberryPerl perl)

        argument:   perl
        value:      Instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        return:     true if the passed in perl is installed, false if not

Checks to see whether a specific Perl instance is installed. Returns `true`
if it is, and `false` if not.

#### PerlsInstalled

    private List<StrawberryPerl> PerlsInstalled()
    
    return: A list of the Strawberry Perl objects currently installed
    
Fetches the list of currently installed Perl instances, and returns a list of objects.
    
#### PerlRemove

    public void PerlRemove(string versionToRemove)

        argument:   versionToRemove
        value:      Name of an installed Perl to uninstall

Removes the Perl instance corresponding to the name sent in.

#### PerlRegisterCustomInstall

    )

        argument:   perlName
        value:      The name you want to use for this new install, which will
                    appear in "berrybrew available"

        argument:   perlBase
        value:      Instance of the StrawberryPerl class
        default:    A non-populated instance

Registers custom Perl instances with `berrybrew`, so they appear in
`berrybrew available` and aren't considered orphans.

If a populated instance is sent in as `perlBase`, we'll use its configuration
information (version, path info, download info etc) in the new custom one. Be
sure if you do this that the base and the new custom instances are the same
version.

#### PerlResolveVersion

    private StrawberryPerl PerlResolveVersion(string name)

        argument:   name
        value:      Name of a Perl as seen in 'berrybrew available'

        return:     The corresponding StrawberryPerl instance object

Resolves the name of a Perl that's available (per `berrybrew available`), and returns
the corresponding object.

        argument:   allPerls
        value:      Bool
         
Fetches the JSON list of Strawberry Perl instances available from
[Strawberry's releases.json](https://strawberryperl.com/releases.json), and
updates the internal `perls.json` available list with the updated data.

If the `allPerls` bool is set to true, we will fetch all available Strawberry
Perl listings.

#### PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans

    public void PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans()

Automatically register any orphaned Perls after using the `Fetch()` method. This
should only be called after a call to `PerlUpdateAvailableList()`.

#### ProcessCreate

    private static System.Diagnostics.Process ProcessCreate(string cmd, bool hidden=true)

        argument:   cmd
        value:      String containing the command and arguments to execute

        argument:   hidden
        value:      true/false whether the new cmd window should be hidden
        default:    true

        variable:   StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput
        value:      true

        variable:   StartInfo.RedirectStandardError
        value:      true

instance the default used across the board. This is persistent until changed.

#### Unconfig

    public void Unconfig()

Removes Berrybrew from PATH.

#### Upgrade

    public void Upgrade()

Creates a `backup_timestamp` backup directory in the repository root directory,
copies the live configuration files from `data` directory, performs a
`git pull`. All configuration files less the `perls_custom.json` file are
overwritten with any new changes. It is up to the user to manually merge in any
custom changes to the other configuration files from the backups into the new
files in `data/`.

#### UseCompile

    public void UseCompile(string usePerlStr, bool newWindow = false)

        argument:   usePerlStr
        value:      Comma-separated list of strawberry perl instances

        argument:   newWindow
        value:      true/false whether new windows should be spanwed or not
        default:    false

Sets things up before handing each command off to `UseInNewWindow()` or
`UseInSameWindow()` for final processing. If the `--win` flag (or
`--window` or `--windowed`) is included, we'll call `UseInNewWindow()`,
otherwise call `UseInSameWindow()`.

This method sends a single Perl at a time to the appropriate
`UseIn*Window()` function, once for each of the specified Perls from
usePerlStr.

#### UseInNewWindow

    private static void UseInNewWindow(StrawberryPerl perl, string sysPath, string usrPath)

        value:      A single StrawberryPerl object

        argument:   sysPath
        value:      String containing the full Machine PATH environment variable

        argument:   usrPath
        value:      String containing the full User PATH environment variable

Called by `UseCompile()`: Creates a new command processor in the active berrybrew
window, with the selected Perl listed first in the PATH inherited by the new
process.
