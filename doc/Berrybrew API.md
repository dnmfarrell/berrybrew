## berrybrew API (bin/bbapi.dll)

API source code is located in the `src/berrybrew.cs` file. It is
standalone namespace/class code, and contains no entry points.

The code for the `berrybrew.exe` binary itself resides in `src/bbconsole.cs` and
contains the `Main()` entry point.

The code for the `berrybrewUI.exe` is in `src/berrybrew-ui.cs`.

- [Message Class](#class-message)

### Exit Status

Most exit statuses will be `berrybrew` specific, except calls that shell out to
separate processes (eg. `Exec()`). In these cases, the exit status code will
be that of the external process, not that from within.

For example, a call to `ExecCompile()` will call `Exec()` which starts one or
more separate processes. If any of those processes fail, the status code will
be that of the failed process (even if all other processes succeed).

## Berrybrew Class

The `Berrybrew` class is the base of the system.

## Class Berrybrew

#### Available

    public void Available(allPerls=false)

        argument:   allPerls
        value:      Bool
        default:    false
         
Displays the names of the versions of Perl that are available to `berrybrew`,
as found in `this.Perls`, where `this.Perls` is a
`OrderedDictionary<string name, Berrybrew.StrawberryPerl>`.

If `allPerls` is set to `true`, we will list all available Perls. Otherwise,
we display only the most recent point release of each major version.

#### AvailableList

    public List<string> AvailableList(allPerls=false)
        
         argument:   allPerls
         value:      Bool
         default:    false   
         
Returns a list of strings of Perl names that are available for install.

If `allPerls` is set to `true`, we will return all available Perls. Otherwise,
we return only the most recent point release of each major version.  

#### BaseConfig

    private void BaseConfig()
    
Initializes the registry based configuraiton.
        
#### CheckName

    private static bool CheckName(string perlName)

        argument:   perlName
        value:      Name of an available Perl

        return:     true on success, false on fail

Checks the name of a custom Perl to ensure it fits within the guidelines.

#### CheckRootDir

    private void CheckRootDir()

Checks whether the Perl root installation directory exists, and creates it if not.

#### Clean

    public void Clean(string subcmd="temp")

        argument:   subcmd
        values:     "temp", "orphan", "module", "dev", "all"

By default, `subcmd` is set to "temp", which we delete all downloaded Perl
installation zip files from the temporary directory. With "orphan", we'll
delete all directories found in the Perl installation root directory that
`berrybrew` has not registered as valid Perl installs.

#### CleanDev

    private bool CleanDev()
    
Removes both the `build` and `test` directories. This method should only
be used by developers of `berrybrew`.

Returns `true` if both directories are non-existent after the routine
has been run, or `false` otherwise.

#### CleanModules

    private bool CleanDev()
    
Removes the directory that we store exported module list files into.    

Returns `true` on success, and `false` on failure.

#### CleanOrphan

    private bool CleanOrphan()

Removes all directories found in the Perl installation directory that aren't
associated with any registered Perl instances.

Returns `true` if any orphans were found/deleted, `false` if not.

#### CleanTemp

    private bool CleanTemp()

Removes all Perl installation zip files from the temporary staging directory.

Returns `true` if any files were found/deleted, `false` if not.

#### Clone

    public void Clone(string src, string dest)

        argument:   src
        values:     Name of an installed berrybrew Perl instance

        argument:   dest
        values:     Any string name by which you want the clone to appear
                    in 'berrybrew available'

Makes an exact copy of an existing installed Perl instance with a name of your
choosing, and makes it available just like all others. `berrybrew available`
will label these custom installs appropriately. 

#### Config

    public void Config()

Adds the path to the `berrybrew.exe` executable into the `PATH` environment
variable.

#### Exec

    private void Exec(StrawberryPerl perl, List<string> parameters, string sysPath, Boolean singleMode)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single StrawberryPerl object

        argument:   parameters
        value:      The full command string you want all installed Perls to execute

        argument:   sysPath
        value:      String containing the full Machine PATH environment variable
        
        argument:   singleMode
        value:      True if running on a single Perl instance, False otherwise

Called by `ExecCompile()`, executes a command on a single Perl instance a
command to execute.

#### ExecCompile

    public void ExecCompile(string parameters)

        argument:   parameters
        value:      Full command string that Exec() hands off, including
                    any Exec() specific instructions

Sets things up before handing each command off to `Exec()` for final
processing. If the `--with` flag is included, we'll strip it off and only
send the commands to be executed to those specific Perls.

This method sends a single Perl at a time to `Exec()`, and will always skip
any Perls that have either `tmpl` or `template` in the name.

By default, we also skip over all custom (cloned) instances. To have them
included, set `custom_exec` to `true` by using `berrybrew options custom_exec true`.

#### Exit

    public void Exit(int exitCode)
    
        argument:   exitCode
        value:      Integer, the exit code to return
        
Simple wrapper for `Environment.Exit()` which allows for stacktrace information
and other customization.

#### ExportModules

    public void ExportModules()
    
Exports a list of all installed modules from the currently in-use Perl
instance.

The process will create a new `modules` directory under the Perl
installation directory (default is `C:\berrybrew`), and the name of the
file will be the version name of the Perl you're exporting from (eg.
`5.20.3_64`).
    
#### Extract

    private void Extract(StrawberryPerl perl, string tempDir)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        argument:   tempDir
        value:      The full path to the temporary Perl installation staging directory
        typical:    this.archivePath

Extracts a Perl instance zip archive into the Perl installation directory.

#### Fetch

    public string Fetch(StrawberryPerl perl)

        argument:   perl
        value:      Single instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        return:     The name of the folder the zip file was downloaded to

Downloads the zip file for the version of Perl found in the StrawberryPerl
object, and returns the directory of where it was put.

#### FileAssoc

    public void FileAssoc(action="", quiet=false)
    
    argument:   action
    value:      String, "set" or "unset"
   
    argument:   quiet
    value:      Bool
    default:    false
     
View, set or unset the file association for `.pl` Perl script files.

If `action` is `set`, we'll update the association and manage it ourselves. If
set to `unset`, we'll revert it back to the way it was prior to a `set` call.

If `action` is left default, we'll display to the console the current setting.

Set `quiet` to prevent the default action from displaying output.

#### FileRemove

    private static string FileRemove(string filename)

        argument:   filename
        value:      Name of an existing file on the system

        return:     Stringified Exception or "true"

Deletes a file from the file system. Returns stringified "true" on success,
and a stringified `IO` exception on failure.

#### FileSystemResetAttributes

    private static void FileSystemResetAttributes(string dir)

        argument:   dir
        value:      Name of a directory that exists in the filesystem

Recursively resets all files and directories within the directory being
operated on back to default. This method was written specifically to ensure
that no files were readonly, which prevented us from removing Perl
installations.

#### Info

    public void Info(string want)

        argument:   want
        value:      One of "archive_path", "bin_path", "root_path" or "install_path"

        argument:   version
        value:      Name of a Perl instance you've exported a module list from
        
Imports a previously exported module list (from a different Perl instance),
and installs all of the listed modules into the currently in-use Perl.

#### ImportModulesExec

    private void ImportModulesExec(string file, string path)
    
        argument:   file
        value:      The name of a Perl instance that you've exported the module list from
        
        argument:   path
        value:      The full path including the file name listed in the 'file' parameter
        
This method is called by `ImportModules()`, and simply performs the routines
that install all of the listed modules within the exported file.
        
#### Install

    public void Install(string version)

        argument:   version
        value:      Name of an available Perl, as seen with 'berrybrew available'

        value:      The name of the JSON file, with the '.json' extension removed

        argument:   raw
        value:      bool
        default:    false

        return:     dynamic // object or JSON string

Extracts the JSON string from the various JSON files, and returns it. If `raw`
is set to `false` (default), we send the data back de-serialized. If `raw` is
`true`, we'll send back the JSON string as-is, with no de-serialization.

#### JsonWrite

    private void JsonWrite(
        string type,
        List<Dictionary<string, object>> data,
        bool fullList=false
    )

        value:      The name of the JSON file, with the '.json' extension removed

        argument:   data
        value:      List of Dictionary objects. Each dict contains the name of an
                    available Perl as the key, and a StrawberryPerl instance as the
                    value

        argument:   fullList
        value:      bool
        default:    false

Writes out a JSON file containing information regarding installed Perls. If
`fullList` is set to `false` (default), we'll read in the existing list in the
file, and append the new objects to it. If `fullList` is set to `true`, we'll
assume you've compiled the list yourself, and we overwrite the file with the
new `data`.

#### List

    public void List()
    
Displays a list of the versions of Perl that are currently installed.

#### Options

    public string Options(string option="", string value="", bool quiet=false)
   
    argument:   option
    value:      String. The name of a valid option
    default:    Empty string
    
    argument:   value
    value:      String. The value of the option you want to set
    default:    Empty string 

    argument:   quiet
    value:      Bool. Display output or not
    default:    false
    
Display, return and set `berrybrew`'s options.

If no arguments are sent in, we'll display the entire list of options, and return
an empty string.

If the `option` arg is sent in with a valid value, we'll display and return the
current value for that option.

If both the `option` and `value` arguments are sent in, we'll set that option
to the value, display and return the updated value.

if `quiet` is set to `true`, we won't display output to the console.

#### OptionsUpdate

    public void OptionsUpdate(bool force=false)

        argument:   force
        value:      Bool
        default:    false

upgrades.

If the `force` argument is sent in as `true`, we will reload all of the 
configuration file values into the registry.

#### Off

    public void Off()

Disabled all `berrybrew` managed Perls, by removing them from `PATH`
environment variables. This will return you to a system Strawberry or
ActiveState system installed Perl.

#### PathAddBerryBrew

    private void PathAddBerryBrew(string binPath)

        argument:   binPath
        value:      Full path to the directory the berrybrew.exe binary resides in

Called by `Config()`, this enables `berrybrew` to be called from the command
line without having to specify the full path to the executable.

housed in the `perl` object will be used on the system.

#### PathGet

    private static string PathGet()

        return:     String containing the machine's PATH data

Using the registry, retrieves the current Machine (System) `PATH` environment
variable. Using the registry ensures we have the most current data, even if
the current shell has not yet been updated.

Does not expand any variable-based `PATH` entries on extraction.

#### PathGetUsr

    private static string PathGetUsr()
    
    return: String containing the currently logged in user's PATH environment variable
    
Fetches and returns a string containing the currently logged in user's `PATH`
environment variable.    

Does not expand any variable-based `PATH` entries on extraction.

#### PathRemoveBerrybrew

        argument:   binPath
        value:      string that contains the path to check against 

        argument:   target
        value:      "machine" or "user"

        return:     true if found, false if not

        value:      List of strings, each string contains a PATH entry
                    (less the semi-colon)

Builds the semi-colon separated `PATH` string from the list, and inserts it
into the Machine's `PATH` section in the registry. We then send a broadcast
message to the system to advise of the change.

We use this manual method as opposed to C# methods, because we change the
registry value from a `REG_SZ` type to `REG_EXPAND_SZ` type so that we can
preserve and insert variable-based `PATH` entries.

#### PerlArchivePath

    private static string PerlArchivePath(StrawberryPerl perl)

don't have any association or registration with `berrybrew`.

#### PerlGenerateObjects

    private void PerlGenerateObjects(bool importIntoObject=false)

        argument:   importIntoObject
        default:    false
        purpose:    Insert the Perl objects into the Berrybrew object

Collects up both the default and custom available Perls from the available
JSON configuration files, and turns the information into `StrawberryPerl`
objects.

Set `importIntoObject` to `true` to have the list of objects imported into the
`Berrybrew` object, at `this.Perls`.

#### PerlInUse

    public StrawberryPerl PerlInUse()

        argument:   perl
        value:      Instance of the StrawberryPerl class

        return:     true if the passed in perl is installed, false if not

Checks to see whether a specific Perl instance is installed. Returns `true`
if it is, and `false` if not.

#### PerlsInstalled

    public List<StrawberryPerl> PerlsInstalled()
    
    return: A list of the Strawberry Perl objects currently installed
    
Fetches the list of currently installed Perl instances, and returns a list of objects.

                    appear in "berrybrew available"

        argument:   perlBase
        value:      Instance of the StrawberryPerl class
        default:    A non-populated instance

Registers custom Perl instances with `berrybrew`, so they appear in
`berrybrew available` and aren't considered orphans.

If a populated instance is sent in as `perlBase`, we'll use its configuration
information (version, path info, download info etc) in the new custom one. Be
sure if you do this that the base and the new custom instances are the same
version.

#### PerlRegisterVirtualInstall

    public void PerlRegisterVirtualInstall(string perlName)

        argument:   perlName
        value:      The name you want to use for this new install, which will
                    appear in "berrybrew available"


Creates a virtual berrybrew instance wrapped around an existing Perl installation.

This can be ActiveState, Strawberry or any other "system" Perl.

[Strawberry's releases.json](https://strawberryperl.com/releases.json), and
updates the internal `perls.json` available list with the updated data.

#### PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans

    public void PerlUpdateAvailableListOrphans()

Automatically register any orphaned Perls after using the `Fetch()` method. This
should only be called after a call to `PerlUpdateAvailableList()`.

#### ProcessCreate

    private static System.Diagnostics.Process ProcessCreate(string cmd, bool hidden=true)

        argument:   cmd
        value:      String containing the command and arguments to execute

        argument:   hidden
        value:      true/false whether the new cmd window should be hidden

instance the default used across the board. This is persistent until changed.

If `switchQuick` is sent in as true, we'll update the system without requiring you
to open a new command line window. However, some binaries and features may not work
correctly when switching quickly.

#### SwitchQuick

    private void SwitchProcess()
    
Called by [Switch](#switch), sets up the new environment so we don't need to
close the current `cmd` window and open a new one for environment variables
to be refreshed.

#### Unconfig

    public void Unconfig()

Removes Berrybrew from PATH.

#### Upgrade

    public void Upgrade()

Creates a `backup_timestamp` backup directory in the repository root directory,
copies the live configuration files from `data` directory, performs a
`git pull`. All configuration files less the `perls_custom.json` file are
overwritten with any new changes. It is up to the user to manually merge in any
custom changes to the other configuration files from the backups into the new
files in `data/`.

#### UseCompile

    public void UseCompile(string usePerlStr, bool newWindow = false)

        argument:   usePerlStr
        value:      Comma-separated list of strawberry perl instances

        argument:   newWindow
        value:      true/false whether new windows should be spanwed or not
        default:    false

Sets things up before handing each command off to `UseInNewWindow()` or
`UseInSameWindow()` for final processing. If the `--win` flag (or
`--window` or `--windowed`) is included, we'll call `UseInNewWindow()`,
otherwise call `UseInSameWindow()`.

This method sends a single Perl at a time to the appropriate
`UseIn*Window()` function, once for each of the specified Perls from
usePerlStr.

#### UseInNewWindow

    private void UseInNewWindow(StrawberryPerl perl, string sysPath, string usrPath)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single StrawberryPerl object

        argument:   sysPath
        value:      String containing the full Machine PATH environment variable

        argument:   usrPath
        value:      String containing the full User PATH environment variable

Called by `UseCompile()`: Creates a new window for a single Perl environment,
with that Perl listed first in the PATH inherited by the new process.

#### UseInSameWindow

    private void UseInSameWindow(StrawberryPerl perl, string sysPath, string usrPath)

        argument:   perl
        value:      A single StrawberryPerl object

        argument:   sysPath
        value:      String containing the full Machine PATH environment variable

        argument:   usrPath
        value:      String containing the full User PATH environment variable

Called by `UseCompile()`: Creates a new command processor in the active berrybrew
window, with the selected Perl listed first in the PATH inherited by the new
process.

#### Version

    public string Version()

        return:     berrybrew version string

Returns the version of the current `berrybrew` binary/library.

## Class Message

Manages the importing, collection and printing of various `berrybrew` output.

#### Message.Add

    public void Add(dynamic json)

        argument:   Deserialized JSON string

    value:      {"label":"msgname","content":["msgline 1", "msgline 2"]}
                converted to:
                Dictionary<(string)label, (List<string>)content>

Adds a message to the structure.

#### Message.Get

    public string Get(string label)

        argument:   label
        value:      Name of a label that coincides with the message content

        return:     String of the message content

Returns the message content that corresponds with a specific message label.

#### Message.Print

    public void Print(string label)

        argument:   label
        value:      Name of a message label

`Console.WriteLine()` the message content corresponding with the labelto
`STDOUT`

#### Message.Say

    public void Say(string label)

        argument:   label
        value:      Name of a message label

Same thing as `Message.Print`, but after printing, calls `Environment.Exit(0)`
and terminates the application.

#### Message.Error

    public void Error(string label)
    
         argument:   label
         value:      Name of a message label
 
Prints the relevant message to `STDERR`.
